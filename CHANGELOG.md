#Version 0.4.0 citizen-kane (2014-11-24)

##General

##Fixes

------------------------------------------------------------

#Version 0.3.5 volver (2014-05-29)

##General
- Added a translation to spanish (thanks for this translation Luis Alfaro de la Fuente!)

##Fixes
- Fixing a bug with the option autoSkipIntro (when it's true), where in the end of a wizard an exception occurred and Sideshow couldn't close properly.
- Lifted up the target arrows, to avoid them to cover the target content.

------------------------------------------------------------

#Version 0.3.4 the-untouchables (2014-05-28)

##General
- Added a configuration option for skipping the intro screen (the tutorials list) if there's just one tutorial available for some context.

------------------------------------------------------------

#Version 0.3.3 raging-bull (2014-01-10)

##General
- Changed licensing to Apache License 2.0 (Now Sideshow is open source software bro! Yeah!!)
- Replaced Google Closure by UglifyJS; though Google Closure compress ratio is a higher (when in Advanced Mode), there are some issues with dead code detection and UglifyJS is considerably faster.
- Changed build script to resolve dependencies in a similar way as Sprocket does

------------------------------------------------------------
There's no changelog before the 0.3.3 version since we became public in this version.
