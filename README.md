[Documentation and Live example](http://fortesinformatica.github.io/Sideshow)

Sideshow is a powerful javascript library which aims to reduce your user's learning curve by providing a way to create step-by-step interactive helps.

*	Explain the features of your application
*	Control your end-user's interaction with your UI
*	Use Markdown to create formatted step descriptions
*	Emphasize what you're explaining in each step (a button, grid, dropdown, form, the whole screen, and so forth) by surrounding it with a fully adaptable mask.

**Just think! The sky is the limit!**

## Usage
All the files needed to use Sideshow are located under the `distr` folder.

1) 	In your HTML, include Sideshow script, its dependencies (put the dependencies before the Sideshow script) and the stylesheet.

**Note**: The stylesheet must be in the `head` and all the scripts (including your own Tutorial scripts) in the bottom of your `body` tag.

**Note 2**: See the `example.html` file in the project root folder for a real example.

2) 	Copy the Sideshow fonts folder in the directory located above the folder where you copied Sideshow stylesheet.

3) 	Create (and also add a reference in your HTML) a `sideshow.config.js` file with this content:

```Javascript
Sideshow.config.language = "en";
Sideshow.init();
```

**Note**: For now, Sideshow only supports `en` (american english), `pt-br` (brazilian portuguese), `es` (spanish, translated by Luis Alfaro de la Fuente, thanks!) and `fr`.

4) 	Create your tutorials and import each one in your HTML after the Sideshow script

### Creating a Tutorial

```Javascript
Sideshow.registerWizard({
    name: "introducing_sideshow",
    title: "Introducing Sideshow",
    description: "Introducing the main features and concepts of Sideshow. ",
    estimatedTime: "10 Minutes",
    affects: [
		{ hash: "#messages" }, //This tutorial would be eligible for URLs like this "http://www.foo.com/bar#messages"
		{ route: "/adm/orders", caseSensitive: true },  //This tutorial would be eligible for URLs like this "http://www.foo.com/adm/orders"
		function(){
			//Here we could do any checking to infer if this tutorial is eligible the current screen/context.
			//After this checking, just return a boolean indicating if this tutorial will be available.
			return $(".grid").length > 0;
		}
    ]
});
```

### Defining a Storyline
A storyline is the sequence of steps of some tutorial.

```Javascript
Sideshow.registerWizard({
    //...
}).storyLine({
    showStepPosition: true,
    steps: [
    	{
		    title: "Hello Sideshow.",
		    text: "This is an oversimplified example."
		},
		{
		    title: "The end",
		    text: "What a pity =(."
		}
	]
});
```

### Step: A complete example

```Javascript
Sideshow.registerWizard({
    //...
}).storyLine({
    showStepPosition: true,
    steps: [
    	{
		    title: "The log out button.",
		    text: "Click this button if you want to log out of the system.",
		    subject: "#user_details_panel",
		    targets: "#user_details_panel > .logout"
		}
	]
});
```

### Using Markdown

```Javascript
Sideshow.registerWizard({
    //...
}).storyLine({
    showStepPosition: true,
    steps: [
    	{
		    title: "Markdown is pretty cool!",
		    text: "This step uses [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) for **text formatting**.",
		    format: "markdown"
		}
	]
});
```

### Completing Conditions
Completing conditions are just (as the name suggests) conditions to be satisfied in order to proceed to the next step.

```Javascript
Sideshow.registerWizard({
    //...
}).storyLine({
    showStepPosition: true,
    steps: [
    	{
		    title: "Choose a name for your project",
		    text: "Enter a name for your project.",
		    completingConditions: [
		    	function(){
		    		return $("#project_name").val().length > 5;
		    	}
		    ]
		},
		//...
	]
});
```

### Auto continue
By setting the autoContinue flag to true, Sideshow proceeds automaticaly when the completing conditions are satisfied.

```Javascript
Sideshow.registerWizard({
    //...
}).storyLine({
    showStepPosition: true,
    steps: [
    	{
		    title: "Choose a name for your project",
		    text: "Enter a name for your project.",
		    completingConditions: [
		    	function(){
		    		return $("#project_name").val().length > 5;
		    	}
		    ],
		    autoContinue: true
		},
		//...
	]
});
```

### Events
You can perform some action or do some preparation for the next step, or anything you want which can be done programatically.

```Javascript
Sideshow.registerWizard({
    //...
    listeners: {
    	beforeWizardStarts: function(){
    		//What goes here will be executed before the first step of this tutorial
    	},
    	afterWizardEnds: function(){
    		//What goes here will be executed after the last step of this tutorial
    	}
	}
}).storyLine({
    showStepPosition: true,
    steps: [
    	{
		    title: "Foo bar",
		    text: "An example of step just to illustrate how to use step events.",
		    listeners: {
		    	beforeStep: function(){
		    		//What goes here will be executed before this step
		    	},
		    	afterStep: function(){
		    		//What goes here will be executed after this step
		    	}
			}
		},
		//...
	]
});
```

### Skipping a step
When entering some step you can do some verification to skip the step automaticaly.

```Javascript
Sideshow.registerWizard({
    //...
}).storyLine({
    showStepPosition: true,
    steps: [
    	{
		    //...
		    skipIf: function(){
		    	return $("#groups").children().length > 0;
			}
		},
		//...
	]
});
```

### Jumping to other step
You can jump to other step by its position (1-based) or its unique name.

```Javascript
Sideshow.registerWizard({
    //...
}).storyLine({
    showStepPosition: true,
    steps: [
    	{
		    //...
		    listeners: {
		    	beforeStep: function(){
			    	if($("#groups").children().length > 0)
			    		Sideshow.gotoStep("the_end"); //we're jumping to the step named "the_end"
			    	else if($("#people").children().length > 0)
			    		Sideshow.gotoStep(7); //we're jumping to the seventh step in this Wizard storyline
				}
			}
		},
		//...
		{
			name: "the_end",
			title: "The end",
			//...
		}
	]
});
```

### Tutorial Eligibility
When a user invokes Sideshow, a list with the tutorials available for the current screen/context is shown. Sideshow knows if a tutorial is eligible for some screen by testing the `affects` conditions of each registered tutorial. If one of the conditions are met, the tutorial is listed.


```Javascript
Sideshow.registerWizard({
    //...
    affects: [
		{ hash: "#messages" }, //This tutorial would be eligible for URLs like this "http://www.foo.com/bar#messages"
		{ route: "/adm/orders", caseSensitive: true },  //This tutorial would be eligible for URLs like this "http://www.foo.com/adm/orders"
		function(){
			//Here we could do any checking to infer if this tutorial is eligible the current screen/context.
			//After this checking, just return a boolean indicating if this tutorial will be available.
			return $(".grid").length > 0;
		}
	]
}).storyLine({
	//...
});
```

### Tutorial Preparation Function
Even if a tutorial isn't eligible for some screen, by using a preparation function a user can access this tutorial from any point of your system/site (by pressing shift-F2).


```Javascript
Sideshow.registerWizard({
    //...
    preparation: function(doneCallback){
    	//if your app is a SPA, you could do some sort of redirection and call the doneCallback function after the page is loaded
	}
}).storyLine({
	//...
});
```

### Related Tutorials
You can also define relationships between tutorials, this way, after finishing a tutorial, the user sees a list of others related to this.


```Javascript
Sideshow.registerWizard({
	//...
	//after finishing the current wizard, the user will be guided to related tutorials
    relatedWizards: [ "creating_user", "groups_and_permissions", "security_settings" ]
}).storyLine({
	//...
});
```

### Skipping the Intro screen (the tutorial list) automatically if there's just one tutorial available for a given context
In the sideshow.config.js file, set the `autoSkipIntro` option to true:

```Javascript
Sideshow.config.autoSkipIntro = true;
//...other configuration options
Sideshow.init();
```


## Invoking Sideshow

*	The user can access the tutorials available for the current screen by pressing `F2`, .
*	The user can access the tutorials available for the current screen + tutorials for other screens with a preparation function by pressing `shift+F2`.
